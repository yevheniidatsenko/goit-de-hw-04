This is a sample text file created to test the functionality of the program.
It contains several lines of text, each designed to mimic real-world data.
For instance, we might include a common keyword like 'error' to simulate a log file.
Sometimes, the keyword 'error' will appear multiple times to ensure the program catches them all.
The goal is to identify specific keywords, like 'error', 'test', or 'keyword', within this text.
We hope this provides a sufficient challenge for the program's capabilities.
